## Goal
The Goal of this project is to build a website where you can find news that challenge your existing biases and believes in order for everyone to break out of their news bubble and in the end to foster understanding of opposing political views. You can better understand people with a different opinion if you are informed about their.news (badum tsss ü•Å)

## Website

### Accessible at [their.news](https://their.news)

In order to achieve this goal, a website will be built which, first detects roughly your existing political standing and then presents you with news articles from the other side of the spectrum.
These articles can be searched and you can freely choose if you want to see news from a more politically left or right sided view.
The media bias chart from [adfontesmedia](https://www.adfontesmedia.com/download-the-media-bias-chart/) will be used to categorise the different websites for the US.

<!-- ### What do the emojis mean?
The emojis represent a simple sentiment analysis which analyses a preview of the article and gives a score about how positive (score > 0.66), or how negative (score < 0.33) the article is. Since this is far from perfect, the emojis should be taken with a grain of salt. -->
## Known bugs
These bugs do not break the website, but might impact the experience slightly

1. The outlet list above the slider does not show all outlets of a given political position and search time. 
2. The articles from the first search of a new topic disregard the bias slider
