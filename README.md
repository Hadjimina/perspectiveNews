## Goal
The Goal of this project is to build a website where you can find news that challenge your existing biases and believes in order for everyone to break out of their news bubble and in the end to foster understanding of opposing political views. You can better understand people with a different opinion if you are informed about their.news (badum tsss ü•Å)

## Website

### Accessible at [their.news](https://their.news)

The website uses the media bias rankings from [adfontesmedia](https://www.adfontesmedia.com/download-the-media-bias-chart/) as well as a news api by [</ newscatcher >](https://newscatcherapi.com/). You are presented with a slider with a few dots. Each dot represents a news outlet (e.g. Reuters, Forbes etc). The news articles shown below the slider always come from newsoulets close the slider. It's super interesting to see how news from the left and news from the right report the same events differently.

<!-- ### What do the emojis mean?
The emojis represent a simple sentiment analysis which analyses a preview of the article and gives a score about how positive (score > 0.66), or how negative (score < 0.33) the article is. Since this is far from perfect, the emojis should be taken with a grain of salt. -->
## Known bugs
These bugs do not break the website, but might impact the experience slightly

1. The outlet list above the slider does not show all outlets of a given political position and search time. 
2. The articles from the first search of a new topic disregard the bias slider
